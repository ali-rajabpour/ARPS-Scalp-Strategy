## Key Features

### 1. **Alligator Oscillator (AO)**
   - Calculation of AO using smoothed moving averages (SMA) of `hl2` with short-term (5) and long-term (34) periods to determine market momentum.

### 2. **RSI-Stochastic Integration**
   - Combines relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic-related weighted moving averages (WMA) for identifying overbought and oversold conditions.
   - Configurable inputs for Stochastic settings (`K`, `D`, and smoothing parameters).

### 3. **Zero Lag Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)**
   - Accurate rendering of 50-period and 200-period zero-lag EMAs for enhanced trend direction identification.
   - Dynamic calculations to correct lag and improve responsiveness.

### 4. **Advanced Candlestick Pattern Detection**
   - Real-time identification of multiple reversal and continuation patterns, including:
     - **Doji (Standard, FlyDragon, Gravestone)**.
     - **Morning Star & Evening Star**.
     - **Shooting Star & Hammer**.
     - **Bearish/Bullish Harami & Engulfing**.
     - **Dark Cloud Cover**.
   - Capability to monitor both current and previous candles for pattern detection.

### 5. **Ichimoku Cloud Integration**
   - Configurable Ichimoku Cloud settings to identify equilibrium, trend reversals, and support/resistance zones.
   - Double Ichimoku Cloud setup for adjusted, multi-timeframe analysis.

### 6. **Parabolic SAR**
   - Utilizes the Parabolic SAR indicator with adjustable step and maximum values to spot potential trend reversals.

### 7. **Trend Continuation Factor (TCF)**
   - Measures the strength of upward or downward trend continuation by summing directional price changes.
   - Provides accurate signals for scalping entries.

### 8. **Multi-layered Trading Signal Logic**
   - Long and Short conditions generated based on:
     - RSI & Stochastic Crosses.
     - EMA Crossovers (50-period vs. 200-period).
     - AO trend changes.
     - Bullish/Bearish Pattern alignment with trend conditions.

### 9. **Custom Alerts for Entries**
   - Alerts for actionable Long and Short entries to ensure the user doesn't miss opportunities.
   - Visual label annotations on key levels for easier decision-making.
